11/02/2002 - Cleaned up the code a bit, made fullscreen/windowed option work,
             fullscreen by default, pass -window on the command line to play
             windowed.
           - Added kludge to deactivate mouse grab when console is active.
           - Fixed some keyboard input problems

08/02/2002 - Removed all GLX stuff, replaced with SDL.  Mouse/keyboard focus
             problems are now fixed.
           - Mouse/keyboard input now uses SDL.  in_dgamouse no longer useful,
             input will use whatever is available with SDL, SHOULD be nice and
             smooth with SDL.
           - modified "quake" script to pass args to glquake binary
