Changed all GLX stuff to SDL in order to fix mouse/keyboard focus problems.
Didn't know enough GLX, plus I think the SDL code is much, much prettier, and
simpler.

See the changelog for more info on all the changes I made.

                NPRQuake for Linux
	Jeremy Green (coolguywithgun@yahoo.com)

  This is a port of NPRQuake to Linux.  I have only tried it on my
machine.  It requires a GLX-compatible graphics card.  To compile,
simply run make from the NPRQuake directory.  Binaries will be placed
in the build subdirectory.  Simply copy (or link) your id1
subdirectory of your quake install into the build subdirectory, then
run the quake shell script from there.  I have had problems getting
Quake to respond to my mouse (and I haven't solved them) and my
keyboard.  I found that minimising all open windows in your current
desktop helps to ensure that Quake gets your keyboard's focus.  Once
you have it running, you can type "r_load <renderer>" from the
console, where <renderer> is one of dr_default.so, sketch.so,
bprint.so, and brush.so.  This is my initial (and probaby final)
release of NPRQuake for Linux.
